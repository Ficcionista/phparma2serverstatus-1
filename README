phparma2serverstatus queries an Arma2 server through PHP and displays information about the server
such as the map that is running, connected players, and other information.


3rd Party Libraries:

This software uses GameQ (version 1.12):

http://gameq.sourceforge.net/

At this time (3/12/12), there appears to be no activity or further development on GameQ.
Another Git repository with more recent work is here:

https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ

However, after initial testing, this updated version did not work. Because of this fact,
the original GameQ version 1.12 was decided to be used.
In the future when this other fork is finished, it may be prudent to switch it over.
